# Polar-File-dump

The functioning file is "PolarParse.py" 
Others are just test files and example polar files generated for E205

Warning: before running clcd_dump need to be removed from the running folder. Because;
  1. its also a txt file where script is supposed to run over all text files
  2. clcd_dump.txt is appended everytime so the results will not be correct if there is a file beforehand running the script.
  
output is clcd_dump.txt

Status : Works as it is supposed to be working wihtout any problem.
